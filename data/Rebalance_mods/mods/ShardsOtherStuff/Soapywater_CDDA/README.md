# Soapy Water-CDDA-Mod
Allows you to chop up soap and mix with water for a very low quality disinfectant substitute to clean out deep bites before they get infected.

Can add to an existing world by modifying the save's mods.json and adding "soapywater" to the list, with a comma behind every entry except the last.
