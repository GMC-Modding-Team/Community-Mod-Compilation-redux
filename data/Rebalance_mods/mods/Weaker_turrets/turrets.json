They were quickly adopted by prisons and inner city police forces, where they demonstrated that 'less lethal' is not the same as 'non-lethal'.  In the days before the cataclysm, massive stockrooms of the things were put into circulation.  On the bright side, although it shoots autonomously, it requires a human operator to relocate, so it's not so mobile anymore.",
