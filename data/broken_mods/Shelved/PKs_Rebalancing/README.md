PKs Rebalancing Mod for C:DDA readme

  Thanks for downloading the mod, and even moreso for taking the time to read a readme.  Im personally hit and miss with which readmes I even bother to look at nowadays.

                         
  This mod, as Im sure you are aware by now, overhauls all the little things about C:DDA to make it a new experience while still using the old mechanics.  Its harder to survive, sure, but not because I directly made it harder to dodge or I did some magic to the code.  I strictly only use JSON to update the game.


    CHANGES

  A quick overview of the overarching changes:

 - Building variations -> Coregame buildings have new layouts or in some cases are made with stone to further protect their loot and any survivors inside.
 - New Buildings ->  New structures are all over the place, things like plantations and cemeteries and spider lairs and demonic abodes that house terrifying monsters ...
 - New Overmap Structures -> New styles of starter shelters, new possible biomes for structures, and new possible terminals and new chances for structures to spawn in between the terminal the city, creating more variety while traveling.
 - New Factions -> Demons inspired by the Doom Franchise appear, and have terrifying abilities.  Ants are refactioned into a stronger force, spiders become threatening, and several new robotic and cyborg enemies appear.
 - New Monsters ->  Old monsters are revisited and new ones are created to fill biological niches in the post-apocolyptic world.  Native life will mutate into new forms over time, and older ones may go extinct over time, leaving a permanent sense of change upon the world.
 - New Factional Relationships -> Some factions have new relationships with one another.  Birds and spiders and zombies and more will interact with minor factions on a more detailed level, and the ai to its fullest to express an ecosystem.
 - New Major Faction Monsters -> Tons of new zombies and zombie evolution paths, New fungal monsters and native fungus wildlife, new triffids to fill their lacking infrastructure, and new monsters and remade bosses for several of the dungeons of the game.
 - New items ->  A whole host of new items are added to the game in order to add variety, fun, or allow rebalancing to the game.  homemade anti-radiation medicine, new scifi ammo and guns, anti-toxins, and more.
 - Rebalanced items -> many old items are rebalanced to make the process of choosing loadout, weapons, and armor somewhat more intuitive and interesting.
 - Supporting Mods -> Compatibility patches, blacklist mods, and mod-author prefered settings all included with download.
 - New/Refurbished Mechanics ->  The return of acidic rain, the increase in radiation, the addition of a enlarged unaligned native wildlife faction, increased robotic presence, new classes and types of NPCs, reworked health modifiers, rebalanced special spawnings, new monster emissions, new status effects, and more all come together to make a new experience on a great game!
 - Reworked mutations, diseases, and other effects.  The coregame diseases are reworked, heat/cold has more effect, and minor effects may take route.  Some monsters can cause special effects.
