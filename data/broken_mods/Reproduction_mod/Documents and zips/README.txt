- Copy the folder "Reproduction mod" to your mods folder for the basic realistic experience.

- Replace the two TALK_COMMON .json files of the base game in: *\cdda\data\json\npcs
with the ones in found in the folder "Replacement files". If you don't and simply put them into the mod's folder then the majority of conversation options will be doubled in their menus and I doubt anyone wants that.

- If you do not want to play for an in-game time of 18 years or more in order for your offspring to grow up then replace the entities and items files in "Reproduction mod" with the ones provided in "Replacement files". Their times have been divided by 40 so that the total amount of time they need to become adults is about half a year.

- The demographic of your offspring is random due to how the game works regarding the spawning of NPCs and their random traits. If it doesn't make sense for them to be X when you and your partner is Y then debug fix it. The sexual organs of NPCs are also random no matter their gender, so fix that with debug too if you encounter issues with it.

- Sex requires both/either of partners to have either a penis or vagina. They're mutations, or traits if you prefer, and can be added or removed via the debug menu. They can also be picked on chargen.

- Sex and romancing is currently only possible with allies. Sex without a romanced partner requires a persuasion check every time. If you have romanced a character to the point of sex then you don't need to pass a persuasion check anymore but needs to be accessed through the last option of the romancing options.

- If you find yourself stuck in the romance progression, think of a gift you'd like to give to your partner. A rare locket, or perhaps a ring.
