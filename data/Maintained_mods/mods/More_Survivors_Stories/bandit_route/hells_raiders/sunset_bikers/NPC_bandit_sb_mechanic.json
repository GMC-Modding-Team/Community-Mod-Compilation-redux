For a while, I managed to live quietly without attracting much attention, but one day these guys found me and captured me.  When the first <zombies> began to roam the streets, they decided to involve me in the common cause.  I didn’t mind much, because there’s more chance of surviving with them than alone.  Here I am a kind of local mechanic.  I go through the insides of the wrecked motorcycles that are being dragged out of the city, and all other things."
