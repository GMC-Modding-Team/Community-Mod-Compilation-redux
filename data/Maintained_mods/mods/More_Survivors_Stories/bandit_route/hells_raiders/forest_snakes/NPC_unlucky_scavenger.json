In one of the houses I stayed longer than usual, sat down to rest, began to read a book and fell asleep.  During a nap, I felt some kind of shaking, I open my eyes.  I saw a gun in front of my eyes and feel like someone is tying my hands.  Then a gag in my mouth, a bag on my head and a strong blow to the temple.  I woke up already here, bound and beaten.  You're not with them, are you?  You must help me escape, <name_g>!  I helped the survivors at the nearby refugee center, they will pay you for saving me.  Please…",
