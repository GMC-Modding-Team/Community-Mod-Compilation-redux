I have known these guys for a long time, because once I was 'lucky' to meet them during one of their forest training sessions.  In short, the meeting was unsuccessful for me, but somehow we got talking and decided to go our separate ways.  When the riots began, I gathered everything useful that I could take away and immediately moved here.  It seemed to me that with a bunch of armed guys I would be calmer, and they weren't against it.  Here I do the same: I hunt game, prepare meat reserves, teach other guys my craft."

If you are a fan of primitive hunting methods, then the skill of disguise is your best friend.  Hang on yourself a few blades of grass, twigs, brush your face with mud and grass and you will be indistinguishable from a tall bush.  Check your bow, sharpen your spear well, and then it's a matter of technique.  Good luck!",
