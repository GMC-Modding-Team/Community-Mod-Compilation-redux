# Not everyone turned into zombies. Some still struggling to live...

Adds 5 new side stories (1 WIP), 1 mission for random NPCs and a story line for Hell's Raiders faction (in early stage of development, fully playable, currently have a decent amount of content).

## How to get to Hell's Raiders story line:

1. Go to Refugee Center and complete first mission of Old Guard representative.
2. IMPORTANT! Talk to OG rep, FM merchant, Doctor and Broker at least ONCE. You will get 4 'You met X' missions. This step is important due to a few JSON limitations.
3. On the second mission of OG representative, find informant and choose the last reply.
