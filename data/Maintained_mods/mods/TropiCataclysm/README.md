# TropiCataclysm

a mod for the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (and possibly Cataclysm: Bright Nights in the future). At the moment the mod is a fork of "Desert Region" but the plan is to grow it into a proper content mod.

## What is TropiCataclysm?

In essence, TropiCataclysm is a conversion of the regular Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It moves the setting of the game from New England to an undefined region in the tropics (loosely based on Central/South America but also carrying some stuff from Africa and maybe Asia/Oceania). Players will have to find a way to survive the collapse of human civilization in a completely new environment, much more hotter than good ol' New England but certainly not a scorching hell. The blob has shown its slimy silhouette here but the real dominants of this place are other kind of extradimensional beings, strengthened and diversified by the ecosystem. these old foes pose a new challenge but they may prove to be the answer to erradicate the malice that has fallen over the world.

## Features

The following list is a WIP but the first steps into it are being set as i learn how to mod this game so take it with a grain of salt

- Update the Regional Map from a Humid Continental setting to a Tropical Rainforest/Tropical Monsoon setting containing dense grasslands, thick forests and rich swamps
- Remove and replace vanilla fauna (both mutated, regular and zombified) with tropical species that cover the same niche
- Add new creatures to make the environment feel more alive and potentially dangerous
- Remove and replace vanilla flora with tropical species of trees and harvestable bushes (vanilla cooking ingredients may still exist as imported goods)
- Remove and replace locations unrelated to the tropics with more fitting locations
- Rebalance/Rework Triffid and Mycus factions in order to make them more important in this setting compared to the Blob
- Rebalance/Rework Ants and Bee factions as they are much more prominent in this setting
- Balance changes (including meat drops)
- New Artifacts
- New Items
- New Mutations
- New Bionics
