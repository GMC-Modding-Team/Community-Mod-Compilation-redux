    "description": "The .32-20 Winchester, also known as .32 WCF (Winchester center fire), was the first small-game lever-action cartridge that Winchester produced. For the time the 32-20 was produced in it was perfect for hunting smaller game. Due to its lower power it is able to kill an animal without destroying much meat, but you'd be better off using a more modern .32 due to having more power.",
