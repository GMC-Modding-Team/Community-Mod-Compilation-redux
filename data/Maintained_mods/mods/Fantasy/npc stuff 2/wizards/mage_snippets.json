      "When casting a spell; any spell, make sure you have everything you need to cast it. Some don't take as long, and are good when you need their effects fast, or don't have time for a long ritual.",
      "Don't try casting long rituals in the thick of combat. Not only will the enermy attack you, but you can't defend yourself when doing that. I hear evocation magic is rather fast, though.",
      "Try and prioritize what magic you need. You only have so much mana at once.",
      "Don't go throwing out evocation magic in the middle of town...It never ends well.",
      "If you like making your own stuff, I'd recommend the infusion classes. It's so much fun making a magic sword!",
      "The alchemist loves their plants. I heard that you can find these out in the wild. Mabey I should go sometime.",
      "Have you ever heard of sigils? They're magical traps that trip when you step on them. Keep an eye out when you're combing ruins next time."
