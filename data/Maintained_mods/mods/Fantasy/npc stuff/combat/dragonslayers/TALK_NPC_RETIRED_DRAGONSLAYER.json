Now it seems the art has turned into one of necessity.", "Heh, there was this one that didn't breathe fire but roared like bellowing thunder and made lightning come from its mouth. I still twitch sometimes from that.", "I'm just glad the dragons on the rise now aren't a bunch of elders. We'd be doomed if that were the case.", "They say if you hatched your own dragon it will be your friend. I know there's a reason why the dragonriders exist but the tales tell of them taming already grown ones.", "It's nice to be able to relax my old bones after all these years. It helps that my job made sure I'd be quite well-off, haha!", "Using a horse in the hunt isn't necessary but it can mean the difference between life and death if you aren't that experienced." ],
