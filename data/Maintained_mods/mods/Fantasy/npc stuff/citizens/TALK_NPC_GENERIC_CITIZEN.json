They needs walls more than guards though.", "The dragon hunters are doing all they can to limit the spread of the wild feral dragons.", "Every night I struggle to sleep for fear of the monsters attacking.", "I can run if I'm on my own but having a family can make things complicated", "Hope the harvest isn't affected too much by the appearance of the monsters.", "What could be behind the appearance of the monsters, I wonder." ],
