# BioCo

BioCo is a mod created for Cataclysm; Dark Days ahead with the goal of reintroducing CBM creation and manipulation, along with new tools/machinery to accomplish this.
The mechanics of the mod make static bases more favourable as well, as BioCo machines must be set up locally which takes many hours and can be incredibly weightly/bulky!





# Getting Started

Thank you for purchasing the BioCo Consumer Manual, Apocalypse Edition!
Now-a-days survivors lack a certain mechanical pep that the old days used to have, the magic touch lost.
Worry not though in a few simple steps, a couple books, and some good ol' software you too can have the power of Compact Bionic Modules at your home crafting station!


First things first you'll have to get your hands on a working BioCo Assembly Machine. As the apocalypse was likely not kind to our existing machines, making one will be your best bet!
For the first components required find an established BioCo AutoDoc unit, often found in hospitals and doctor's offices, and *carefully* deconstruct it. 
We're legally obligated to inform you that even in the apocalypse this is technically still a crime.
No worries though, as once you've deconstructed the machine you may now notice new bits. A BioCo AutoDoc Core and some Autonomous Machine Parts!


While the Bioco AutoDoc Core is a one and done deal for this outing you'll likely need to find more Autonomous Machine Parts, as we'll be needing five!
These fancy bits of future's past can be found by taking apart more BioCo AutoDoc units, or some robotic assembly arms from your local, legal, exprimental labratory.
Once again, we're required to tell you that not only would stealing these machines from a lab be illegal, but likely also get you killed in the process.
Aquiring the Autonomous Machine Parts is only half the battle! At a whooping 60L per piece, and 50KG per you'll need a strong beast of burden to move these, and carrying them up from the depths of a lab may be a risk venture!


Now that you've gathered the parts you'll likely need a book or schematic to help you figure your way around these foreign parts. (Assembly schematic sold seperatly from manual)
It will take a survivor of great skill with a broad book collection to recreate handy BioCo Tech after all!
Once all components are gathered, books laid out, and popcorn popped the real magic can begin. Go ahead and use your new parts, some electrical doodads, follow your manual and create your very own BioCo Assembly Machine!
Don't forget, once the machine is created it will have to be set up via your construction menu, or it'll be completely useless. And once that machine is together, moving it will be a doozy as it clock in at 300L and 250KG!





# The Assembly Machine

The BioCo Assembly Machine will accomplish all those fine mechanical wonders required for CBM manipulation! 
As your machine is likely a poorly made, illegal, and suspicious version of our machines the capability will be severly limited to absolutely non-existent at first. 
If you want to upgrade your new best non-sentient friend, you're gonna need more BioCo Tech! Specifically, the CBM software line.
Aquiring such software intact after the apocalypse is sure to be no easy task, but those of a more intelectual or engineering oriented passion are likely to hold onto such things!
Finding one of these software lines loaded into a USB will allow you further use of your BioCo Assembly Machine, opening up new CBMs for creation!
