# About This Mod

A very work-in-progress start to a more Lovecraftian-focused version of Cataclysm set in the 1920s, with 99.9% of the population mysteriously disappearing at midnight of day 0.  

Players will take on the roles of investigators in a variety of professions battling the denizens of the shadows to recover and rebuild society.


# Planned list of features

- Removal of Zombies from game to focus more on the Mythos elements

- Addition of further Mythos creatures to compliment the already existing ones (elder things, ghouls, ghasts, nightgaunts, deep ones, dark young, shantaks, servitors, rat-things etc.)

- Addition of cults\cult-like possessions among the remaining humans (Esoteric Order of Dagon, Yithian Time Travellers, Insects from Shaggai, Church of Starry Wisdom etc.)

- Reworking of existing items\buildings\vehicles to 1920s levels of construction and technology and removing the ruined aspect to represent people just vanishing (meals on tables etc.)

- Plus much more to come
