# Solar Corporations
The true powers of the age, Solar Corporations are vast corporate entities and industrial conglomerates that formed when outer space was privatized during Earth's early space age. 

All solar corporations are space industry giants, they build ships and orbital foundries, manage interstellar shipping, and control their own colonies which sometimes might span entire planets. 

The Solar Corporations currently mentioned in the mod are:
* **Wraitheon Industries ltd.** 
* **EINAC Domestic Works**
* **Mercurial Genomics** 


# Technology
Much was lost during the discontinuity. Colonies that survived relied on technology not much more advanced than the early space age of Earth. While artifacts from before the discontinuity can be found, the secrets of their functionality and construction are often lost. These artifacts can range from exotic weapons to seemingly miraculous medicines, from superefficient power cells to teleportation. Salus IV, as a pre-discontinuity colony is a known source of some of these artifacts, drawing archaeologists and treasure hunters alike.
