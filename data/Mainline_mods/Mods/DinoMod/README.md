# DinoMod
A content addition mod for Cataclysm: DDA, adds dinosaurs to fight, befriend or just to add something fun and new. Intended to work with all other vanilla-DDA based mods, but probably not total conversions.

# Takeaway Features
Intended for all players and includes content of varying difficulty 

 - Introduces dinosaur faction, which operates and interacts in a similar way to vanilla factions like the blob or the fungus
 - Spawns a rich variety of dinosaurs in many locations based on natural habitat and story
 - Includes additional story content related to the new dinosaurs
 - Spawns new locations outside cities and adds variants to certain areas
 - Dinos lay eggs, some can be tamed and ridden, and spawns change seasonally and as the game progresses
 - Higher difficulty encounters can be found in labs, along streams, and in swamps, some with better loot
 - Three new dinosaur mutation lines
