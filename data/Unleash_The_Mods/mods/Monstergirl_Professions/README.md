# Monstergirl Professions
This mod adds various monstergirls (or boys) as professions. I've also added a few add-on mutations to buff some underwhelming or negative mutations, they are only available via these professions.

Note that some of these are bound to be unbalanced, since I have relatively little experience with the game.

**Installation:** Move the `Monstergirl Professions` folder to `CDDA-Root/mods`

Currently there are 6 different monstergirl starts, each with an extra variation for mutant scenarios.
