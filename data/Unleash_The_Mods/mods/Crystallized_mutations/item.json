Its open veins eternally bleed a shimmering liquid that evaporates quickly. 'Only by drinking from the crystal heart shall you be one with the earth and its treasures.' - Excerpt from the strange gem-covered journal. Trying it as is won't get you anywhere though, the book doesn't say anything obvious about how to stabilize the liquid and now the strange liquid evaporates too quickly to be drank. You'll have to find another way if you want to do anything with it.",
