    "description": "Perhaps OmniCorp achieved the high water mark in WMD miniaturization. 10 grams of uranium-233 encased by depleted uranium and a very tiny deuterium-tritium fusion core deeper inside as booster. Highly experimental, it was never found out if the average soldier could throw it far enough to avoid the blast. Activate if you dare. If you don't want to risk dying in an atomic blaze of glory, you might prefer to set it up over the world's most dangerous RC car instead.",
