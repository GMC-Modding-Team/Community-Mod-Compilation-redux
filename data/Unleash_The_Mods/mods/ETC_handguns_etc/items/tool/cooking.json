    "description": "The Chainsword is a \"combat-ready\" electric carver powered by UPS. It was the result of a crowdfund campaign by die-hard fans of a tactical board game with miniatures set in a grimdark medieval space opera with marines among others wielding chainsaws, swords and even axes. With a perfectly balanced pommel for parrying and extremely sharp diamond serrated blades, it is surprisingly effective but very few were made due to high production costs and low demand.",
