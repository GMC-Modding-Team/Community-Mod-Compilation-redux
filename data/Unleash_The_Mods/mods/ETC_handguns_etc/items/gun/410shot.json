    "description": "Not content with creating a magazine-fed double barrel shotgun, OCG went even further with the triarii: a gas-operated, magazine fed triple barrel shotgun. Fortunately for the wrists and shoulders of its users, it is chambered for the lighter .410 shot and is semi auto only with a fire selector lever for one, two or three simultaneous shots as a more ergonomic alternative to three separate triggers. Felt recoil is very manageable thanks to its built-in accessories. Compatible with 10-round Saiga-410 magaziness.",

While the \"big bucket\" of an integrated suppressor may be a first, being fed by a non-detachable magazine inside its hollowed grip is also very unusual for a shotgun.",
