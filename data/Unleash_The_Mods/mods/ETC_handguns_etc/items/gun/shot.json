    "description": "This is a short, light and compact enough double barrel shotgun to be wielded one-handed and used as a \"sidearm\", with a pair of very small tubular magazines holding only 2 shells each. Curiously, it was part of a crowdfund campaign by die-hard fans of a tactical board game with miniatures set in a grimdark medieval space opera with inquisitors among others using similar but larger bore and gyrojet based \"handguns\". Like the Inquisition, nobody expected this.",

    "description": "This prototype now snatched from OmniCorp Skunkworks by a survivor is either utterly mad or the ultimate holdout gun. It has one tiny tubular magazine that would be pointless in a shotgun with a conventional action because it can store only one shell. Even more strange it has no trigger, just a safety lever. This is likely the world's first slam fire only shotgun: faster to reload than a normal break action shotgun, with safety off, once a shell is in, the action will shoot it immediately, not even a trigger pull required.",
