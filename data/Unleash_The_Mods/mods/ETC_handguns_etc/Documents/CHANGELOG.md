# Release 4 - Mar/2021 for Bright Nights

## JSON fixes and compatibility

- Fixed switchable battery tool or loading port gun mods to be truly irremovable once installed in a gun.

- Fixed range modifier for SMC223.

- Added lightweight replacement furniture to the Combo X912 of the Leadworks Executive so it can be wielded one-handed by a STR 8 character.

- Updated contents of ER555 pattern conversion packs previously using obsolete 40mm grenade ids.

## Balance

- Changed 7.62 EC orbital to have the same armor penetration of as 7.62 ECHV, except that it is applied over only 25% of a target's armor, completely bypassing the rest.

- Buffed 5.56 ETC damage by 20% thus 5.56 DK now deals about as much damage as a 6.5 Grendel or 6.8 Remington SPC round would if they were added to the base game while making the advantage of 5.56 SAP over its 5.56 NATO counterpart more significant.

- Redefined damage and armor penetration values of ETC rounds to be calculated relative to base game ammo values through copy-from, ensuring they will automatically match any changes to game balance and adjust to any differences between BN and DDA.

- Increased the ranges of 9mm ETC HAPM, 5.56 DK, 7.62 ECHV, 1.06mm magmg and orbital rounds to 100, 120, 125 and 200 respectively.

- Changed armor penetration progression in non subsonic 9mm ETC ammo types to 0 - 19 - 28 - 47 and made HVHP always deal 25% more damage vs. unarmored compared to FMJ.

- Removed distinction between 5.56 ETC and 5.56 NATO STANAG magazines. Now all of them, including real ones, support both ammo types in addition to .300 BLK, furthermore 5.56 ETC rifles are STANAG-compatible.

- Adjusted dimensions or capacity of some of the new 5.56 magazines to be close enough to real ones while remaining better in volume efficiency.

- Fixed overpriced ETC rounds, except for 7.62mm EC. $15 per shot is still dirt cheap for something that includes a very tiny plutonium cell.

- Replaced FLARE ammo effect from plasma shotgun with new and much more !FUN! WOOLYPETER_SHOT effect, which will really turn up the heat all over in the air, as expected from something with stellar temperatures.


## New Content

- XE50 Ion Mace, a power hungry scatter electrolaser pistol fed by medium batteries which completely ignores most armor by dealing electric damage with both stun and EMP effects, but useless vs. electric-immune foes. High DPS but weak "single" shot damage.

- Light Guided Weapon, a very accurate rocket launcher with four tubes that can be loaded with two different rocket types at once, including a new white phosphorus rocket with an unique AOE and even a rocket propelled version of what is mentioned right below.

- Nuclear Grenade so the children of a dead Earth can make it even more dead. Unfortunately the Cataclysm happened before its field testing as a thrown grenade. Could also be set up in a RC car for the world's tiniest and most dangerous car bomb ever.

- OCGES Biorifle, a profession-exclusive man-portable "water" cannon that is acidproof and can shoot concentrated acid instead, which type was converted from comestible to ammo for this to become possible.

- Added option to install any of the ETC and new conventional guns that can be loaded with ammo belts, the XNU laser, the coilguns, the OCGES, the Excidia automatic shotgun or the plasma shotgun into a vehicle turret mount.

- Added unique custom starting vehicles for all the executives and corporate spymaster professions. Two sports cars and three SUVs respectively, deathmobile starter packs in skilled hands with the right tools.

- Added handloaded subsonic 5.56 NATO recipes. Really weak though, better to get an American-180 and put a suppressor in it or the new gun mentioned below. Still could be useful in some what-ifs involving procedural spawns and a lot of bad luck.

- SSR300 Wisp, a bulky and integrally suppressed .300 BLK gun designed to be used as sniper rifle for covert night operations, based upon the MR9SD. Direct equivalent to the VSS Vintorez.

- Optional, toggleable G11 override minimod, which converts 4.6mm to 4.73mm caseless, including the MP7, and adds the H&K G11 and a 4.73mm UCP. In it there is a toggleable setting to replace all 8x40mm Rivtech guns, mags and ammo with 4.73mm too.

- Included SFX configuration of the new guns for @'s soundpack in the modmods folder.
