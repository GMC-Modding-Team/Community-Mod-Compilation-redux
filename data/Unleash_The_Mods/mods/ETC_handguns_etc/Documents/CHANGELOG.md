# Release 2 - Jan/2021 for Bright Nights (not tested in mainline 0.E but should work too)

## JSON fixes and compatibility

- Adjusted syntax and content of all .json files for compatibility.

- Fixed Corporate Spymaster profession to properly carry a .22 ETC stealth pistol.

- Fixed Vault Newcomer challenge starting location which should never mismatch now, just one level further undeground because keeping it in the same Z-level as before won't work. Guaranteed !FUN! increase.

- Set up new migration settings for Leadworks guns removed from vanilla to the "reimagined" versions for the 1 in one billion odds of someone trying this mod and having a save that will benefit from this.

## Balance

- Removed all non-exclusive gun mods, replaced with vanilla ones. Gyroscopic stabilizers in rifle caliber "pistols" were replaced with folding wire stocks.

- Adjusted rate of fire of automatic weapons to match changes in the vanilla weapons autofire specs and remain balanced in relation to them.

- Added folding wire stocks to some guns which recoil and rate of fire really makes having no stock at all in them madness.

- Adjusted firearms dimensions to a balanced match between realism and fun, also to fit properly with the new maximum volume restrictions of holsters according to their intended purposes(backup pistol, fast draw main pistol, big main pistol, etc).

- Reduced capacity of the O9 electromagnum and doublemag to only 4 rounds, matching the bigger 5.56 ADR and 7.62 AMR and allowing the same speedloader to also be used by a new 9mm derringer. Reduced their volume accordingly to also fit in fast draw holsters.

- Migrated damage that should be from the rounds to the rounds JSON instead of having the total damage value split between rounds and guns for noise reduction and defined specific loudness values for all pistol caliber ETC bullets.

- Rebalanced several .22 ETC and 9mm ETC rounds specs with a more drastic gradient in stopping power vs. armor penetration among different ammo types. IE: .22 ETC microflechette - 9 dmg and 60 AP vs. .22 ETC TB - 27 dmg and 0 AP.

- Buffed base stopping power of .22 ETC by 20%  to match the rebalance of .22 in Bright Nights. Damage value for default APM rounds increased to 18 (2 points above .22 LR).

- Changed .308 SMC from being compatible with only M14 magazines to using its own non-detachable tubular magazine.

- Changed starting weapons for the corporate spymaster profession. EMP Projector was replaced with a YM14 PDW loaded with 10mm Auto plus 2 spare magazines while the 12C Storm Bolter shotgun was replaced with a modded and scoped V29 laser pistol.

- Gave the corporate spymaster a new and completely exclusive, never spawned anywhere starting gun: a crazy slam fire only shotgun prototype.

- Some small adjustments to spawn distribution and the new stuff added to spawns of course.

## New Content

- Added tube loaders for the new guns with magazine tubes, speedloaders for the new revolvers and alike.

- One magazine fed triple barrel .410 shotgun, the OCG410 Triarii, to put the nuts in gun nuts.

- One automatic, SMG-like .410 shotgun, the OCG410A SBMP, because there is no spray and pray like loading a magazine in a shotgun similarly to how one is loaded in a MAC-10 then trying to control the muzzle climb once buckshot starts flying.

- One theoretically possible if not necessarily practical compact .410 shotgun vaguely resembling a Micro-Uzi with an integral suppressor for "silent" breaching or madmen who want a "silenced" shotgun instead of a SMG; The OCG-410S Sicarius.

- OCG 12D Slam Dunk as an exclusive starting gun for the Corporate Spymaster profession, a prototype that was not yet put into production when the cataclysm happened, perhaps for a good reason, but quite powerful, with a higher sustained rate of fire than most shotguns.

- YM14 Carbine PDW, a pistol caliber carbine designed to emulate the stopping power and range of the M1 carbine with 10mm auto, also compatible with .40 S&W. Plus a 6-round backup pistol and a variant of the chaingun rechambered for these calibers too.

- "Restored" the Enforcer autorevolver as the OCG-Leadworks 460 with some changes: ammo capacity reduced from 6 to 5, uses vanilla holographic sight and a detachable laser sight and is compatible with more gun mods if becoming too big for a normal holster isn't a problem.

- Added .45 colt and .410 shot variant of the Leadworks Enforcer as OCG-Leadworks 45 Sixpack. Sixpack of Colt45 not included. Don't load it with blackpowder rounds.

- Reimagined the L12 Defender as the OCG-Leadworks 12C Storm Bolter. Sort of like a double barrel Serbu Firearms Super-Shorty Mini-Shotgun. While a bootleg Winchester 1887 has a larger magazine, this one has among other advantages a preposterous origin story, for it was crowdfunded by big fans of the Cataclysm universe equivalent to Warhammer 40k."

- Reimagined the 9mm Leadworks L9 Lookout revolver as the OCG-Leadworks Quad9 holdout derringer. Small enough for any holster, it fires all its four barrels simultaneously and is compatible with the same speedloader used by the O9 electromagnum. For those moments when 4 9mm bullets make the difference between YASD and survival.

- OCG-Leadworks T9, a heavyweight 9mm backup pistol made mostly of tungsten and other high density materials to reduce felt recoil while still being easily concealable.

- Reimagined the L39B as the OCG-Leadworks 923, which is closer to a Steyr TMP in dimensions than to a Beretta 93R but serves the same purpose, minus built-in accessories.

- In the grim darkness of the Cataclysm, diamond edged chainswords are real now also thanks to crowdfunding by not-Warhammer40k fans. They can replace electric carvers in a kitchen and while not folded 1000 times, cut a lot better than katanas.

- Atomic Irish coffee, which is the same as the default one, but made with atomic coffee instead of plain coffee or coffee syrup.

- Added Gunslinger of the Future profession, which starts with one OCG-L 45, one O9 Electromagnum, some ammo for both, some aluminum powder and knowledge plus skills to hand load ETC pistol ammo.

## New Fluff

- OmniCorp incorporated Leadworks when their original designs were still being prototyped. Take this with the grain of salt any fanon deserves.

- Renamed the O0238 submachinegun to 02020 so it is not inherently contradicting any retcon of mainline canon regarding timeline of the Cataclysm unless it gets even more retcons. Also Cyberpunk 2020.

- Redefined the vanilla description of plutonium cells in a more sci-fi way that doesn't contradict the explanation in the description for the self-charged 7.62mm electrothermal round, or the mad science to create smaller liquid core nanoreactors out of plutonium cells and complete disregard for radiation poisoning risks.
