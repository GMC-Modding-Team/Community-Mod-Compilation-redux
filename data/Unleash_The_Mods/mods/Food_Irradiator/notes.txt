There's a weird bug that makes irradiated foods so they can't be properly overridden by this mod.
The intent was to switch to 5x the shelf life instead of a standard 3mo amount.
The irradiated_foo.txt files are the originals, but don't work.
If you want that, you have to rename them .json and replace them in the vanilla files.
