# PrepperCache
Mod for Cataclysm DDA - Prepper Caches

This is a simple mod that adds 'prepper caches' to the game.  These are small locations that 'doomsday preppers' have used to stash supplies in case of the apocalypse.  This mod only adds one new item, a map for the caches.  Otherwise, it only works with vanilla items and groups.

The inspiration for this is the game The Long Dark, in which there are small bunkers full of supplies.  In that game, each cache contains different supplies following a theme (clothing, weapons, food, etc.).  Because they were the basis for the mod, my locations follow a similar theme.

The caches come in the following flavors --
Food, Medical, Armor/Clothing, Tools, and weapons (there is a basic weapons cache and an advanced weapons cache).  There is also a small chance of finding a full bunker.  The full bunker is probably the least balanced of all, as it has a lot of supplies and only a few challenges.

Why didn't they store all types of supplies together?  Hell if I know, ask the folks who made The Long Dark.

So, right, small little bunkers found in the woods that contain a specific type of supplies.

I'm not good at balancing things, so these might be 'free supplies' and little else.  Similarly, there isn't anything particularly exceptional in the basic caches.  A mid-tier character will probably have one or two of everything you can find here.  For new players, though, finding a cache of food or tools could be very useful.

That's it.  Thanks for checking out my mod.
