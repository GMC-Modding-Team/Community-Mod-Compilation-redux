    "description": "A bio-mechanical tower that is designed to spray a fine fungicidal mist over a large area. Needs a tank from which to receive a fungicidal synthesis base to kick-start its synthes-processes and electricity to power the pumps and stimulate the barely-alive organic synthesizers. Resources for continual synthesis are mostly air-born, so for as long as it has power and something to base off of it should continue replacing the local atmosphere bubble with fungicide. Unfortunately, once it has run out of its trigger synthesis base it cannot be turned off until it runs out of power.",
