  Forgotten Realms.
  
Opening statement:
I'm thinking elves and orcs for the forests, trolls and goblins in the swamps, drow, kobolds and ogres in the caves and mines. I'll give them appropriate weapons and armor as well, maybe have a player scenario...this has gotten my interest, I'm way more interested in this than my fruitless pursuit of better npcs and grabbable items, for the moment. Chezzo has made noises about adding graphics for elves orcs and goblins from this mod, also.
