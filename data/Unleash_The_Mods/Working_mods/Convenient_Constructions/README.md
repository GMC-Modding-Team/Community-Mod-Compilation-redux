# Convenient Constructions
Construct large machines and move rare ones.

# Overview
This mod comes in three parts, which can be separately disabled if you choose.
## ATM Recycler and more
This module enables you to construct ATMs, Recyclers, and a few miscellaneous furniture items at your home base. They require parts and appropriate skills.
## Autodocs are movable
This module will allow you to disassemble autodocs to retrieve their valuable cores, which can be used to construct a new autodoc elsewhere. In this way, you still need to find them in the first place, and can't just pull one out of thin air.

Autodocs will also need autonomous machine parts to build. These parts can be found while deconstructing autodocs, or robot arms, frequently found in factories and some heavy machinery areas or labs. **Autodocs will only work if adjacent to an autodoc couch,** which you can also construct.
## CVD machines are movable
Like the above module, this requires you to find and dismantle a CVD machine, after which point you can reconstruct it somewhere else.
