This option allows you to construct your own CVD machine, but only if you've found one already.

Constructing a CVD machine requires a CVD Terminal Core, which can only be found by disassembling an existing CVD machine terminal first. You can then construct a new CVD terminal anywhere using this Core. Having an adjacent CVD machine body is not necessary.
