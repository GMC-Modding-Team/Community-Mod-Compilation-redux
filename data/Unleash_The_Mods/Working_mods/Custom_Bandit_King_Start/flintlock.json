    "description": "A beautifully decorated, hand forged, and clearly made with love by a modern master craftsman long barrel flintlock pistol. It is made of solid oak, inlaid with gold, encrusted a ruby in the handle, and fitted with all bronze parts. It is also engraved with various litanies of hatred against undead filth. It seems more durable and more refined than your usual flintlock pistol. It also has rifling inside! If using this doesn't make you feel a filthy rich badass, nothing will.",
