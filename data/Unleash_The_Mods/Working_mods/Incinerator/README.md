Incinerator
===
This mod introduces a player-made incinerator which can quickly and easily destroy any unwanted items.


Creating an Incinerator
===
The recipe is auto-learned at Fabrication 3, and is not terribly difficult or expensive. Find the recipe under the Electronic_Other tab.


Placing or Dismantling the Incinerator
===
Once you've crafted it, just (a)ctivate it from your inventory and choose the adjacent tile you wish to place it in. Be warned that any items here already, or any items placed into this space therafter, will be destroyed and cannot be recovered.
To pack it back up, simply bump into it.


How it Works
===
Due to particulars of the code, the incinerator is *technically* treated as a stationary non-hostile entity rather than a construction. It's fine. Don't worry about it.
So the incinerator is a friendly "monster" with the ABSORBS ability, which, like the amoebic slime, allows it to devour any items in its tile. Because it's also IMMOBILE it won't move around your base eating whatever it finds.
As a consequence however, it gains HP from every item it eats, with no cap. Eventually you will have an immortal incinerator-monster sitting in your base. Because it can't attack, it should be fine. Probably.
