・ Modification and redistribution are free within common sense.

* 1. The reason why almost immortal decoys are completed
Monsters with the "ABSORBS" flag will absorb any items placed under your feet (destination).
At this time, the current HP rises "above the maximum HP" in proportion to the capacity of the absorbed item, and does not return over time.
The former Shogos had this flag, so the Shogos that absorbed a large amount of items was almost immortal.
