# CDDA Beam Sword Construction
Adds the beam sword, a powerful and difficult to make endgame weapon made from a crystalized portal shard.

Be warned -  the beam sword is quite an exhausting undertaking to create.

*Detailed construction information and a full component list can be found on the Wiki tab above.*

## Constructing the weapon

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛  
┣━ the outer casing  
┣━ a power assembly  
┣━ a focusing assembly  
┣━ a blade emitter

┣━ the field energizer that keeps the blade ignited  
┣━ an energy modulation circuit  
┣━ a diamond focusing lens

## Finding the recipe

A new book, Portal Shard Combat Applications, has a low chance to be found in bank vaults.

## Finding the beam crystal

The crystal shard can be found in labs and is usually located near portals.

## TO DO
+ add tiles to chesthole's set
+ sort recipes so beam sword is first
+ ~~balance out the all construction recipes~~
+ ~~make the crystal shard discoverable without the trailer park mod~~
+ set up the beam sword to have an ON / OFF state
+ beam sword sheath? maybe, but only when switched off
+ more crystal types? electric would protect you from electricity, flame ignites on hit, defensive has mad parry ability
+ melee mods? sounds like a lot of work

Possible melee mods, if I ever get that working..
