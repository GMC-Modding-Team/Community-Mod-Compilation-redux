# Bat-Mutations
  A mod for cataclysm which adds a bat mutation category, working as of 0.E-7938  
  There are currently 2 branches available, the main one and another with a pseudo humming bird beak mutation as well as both herbivore and carnivore in the pool.

## Overview  
 This mutation is centered on poor sight and greatly increased hearing with the added benefit of wings, as well as having a repaint of the Antennae mutation. A good  choice if you want some of the benefits of the bird category but don't want to sacrifice ALL your durability for it.

## Mutations  
This category shares some of the negatives of the bird category but sticks to the lower intensity versions, it has a couple of new mutations:
- Bat Ears: Like Rodent Ears, but with twice the hearing power.
- Echolocation: Re-skin of Antennae due to it's hard coded nature, may be different in the future.
- Bat Wings: Same as bird wings, but causes 2 encumbrance on each arm. (the original Bat Wings was renamed to "Deformed Wings".
  
## Recipes  
This only adds a mutagen and a serum that target the bat category, it is learned in the same way as the Beast mutagen/serum, it has the same costs as the Mouse mutagen/serum.
