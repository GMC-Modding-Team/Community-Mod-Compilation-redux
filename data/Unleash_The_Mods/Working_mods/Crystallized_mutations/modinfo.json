    "description": "Adds a mutation path that turns you into a crystalline humanoid, something like a golem basically. At the end of it all you'll be extremely tanky but your natural healing rate will be abysmal and you'll be quite slow. If you want to heal faster then mineral glue is your friend. NOTE: If you're a user of my targeted mutations mod, make sure this mod loads after targeted mutations. The hp-increasing mutations won't be available via mutagenic use otherwise. HINT: Mansions are the buildings that can spawn with the mod's book.",
