    "description": "A rather macabre fusion of biological matter and machine. Like a modern frankenstein you've used living tissue as a medium, some triffid organic components, various mutagens, some fresh blob to give it another kick at life, and a huge amount of electro-stimulators and stitchwork to create a barely-alive construct specifically engineered to synthesize fungicide from a pre-existing base and the air. For as long as it has power and a biological fungicidal base substance to start up it will continually replace a local atmospheric bubble with a fine toxic fungicidal mist. You've attached the roots of this myco-triffid construct to a metallic base that you can use to attach or remove the tower to or from any appropriate construct you wish. Unfortunately, once it has run out of its trigger synthesis base it cannot be turned off until it runs out of power.",
