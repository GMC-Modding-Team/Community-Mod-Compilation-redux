    "description": "A curious OmniCorp Skunkworks prototype, this looks a bit like a fire truck water cannon and performs just like one if you load it with with normal water or connect it to the water tank of a vehicle. The difference is that this is acidproof and a strong enough survivor could fire it unmounted. Supposedly its inventor created it due to a strange mood after reading Fahrenheit 451.",
