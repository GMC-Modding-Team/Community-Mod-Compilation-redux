    "description": "A perosnal journal of the legendary singer Dean Domino. The last entries contain his story of attempting to rob the Sierra Madre casino vault the night the apocalypse came, then upon failure staying in the villa planning yet another heist attempt while undergoing ghoulification caused by prolonged expousure to the Cloud of toxic gas, finally the story of a mysterious \"Courier\" who once saved Dean's life when together with him (and two other mysterious characters called \"Dog/God\" and Christine) was forced to work for a dangerous, insane man calling himself \"Father Elijah\" who also wanted to crack the Sierra Madre Vault open. The most important content of this journal for you is probably the recipe for a special drink, \"Sierra Madre Martini\". According to it, mixing the Cloud residue with common pre-apocalypse junk food in a tin can will change the properties of the toxins to actually strengthen one's body instead of harming it. Also contains some info regarding setting up and disarming traps.",

    "description": "Another (!) shipment of kitchen knives for the Cantina Madrid came in today, with their new \"space age\" alloy polymer material. We've got way more than we need for the Gala Event, even if everyone had 3 steak knives! But it's always the best for Sinclair, always, always, always, always, he insists everything must be perfect. These knives are sharp, too sharp! One of the chefs almost lost their thumb when dicing vegetables, and were losing cutting boards at the rate of at least one per day. The knives just slice right through them! Running out of dishrags to mop up the blood.",

I loved you very much, and whatever possessed you to choose Dean's arm over my hand is beyond me. Whether it was greed or lust, it has led you here and will forever keep us apart. I hope it leaves you as empty as you left me. As much as you sought what was inside the Sierra Madre, now it will keep you. The door has sealed, the elevator has left, and not even your voice will unlock it. This casino was my gift to you, and you now will be its heart for all time. Sincerely, Frederick Sinclair",
