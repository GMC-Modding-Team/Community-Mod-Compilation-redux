## Abberations/Enigmas
Vile creatures that are rarely sighted in the wilderness and/or certain locations.

* _**Ayenel**_ **!** - A towering abomination, with maximized range of vision. It excels in combat abilities and a baneful eye capable of disrupting its target.

## Robots
Corrupted pieces of machinery on their goal for eradication.

* **Secronom Dragon** **=** - An experimental reptilian creature, unknown to what caused it to inherit the dragon-like traits. Its enormous body paired with specialized armor plating makes it a formidable foe, with large weaponry system installed to bring wrath on its target.

# Monster Roles
All monsters aren't designed to kill the target, and thus providing roles to them is a must (imo). I categorized their type as:

* (**!**) *Aggro* - monsters that focuses on dealing damage, and most hostile creatures belong to this role. Some have their own abilities to inflict status modifiers on targets, or just to deal even more damage.

* (**+**) *Support* - monsters that are sometimes weak and feeble, but takes the chance to provide benefits for its team, such as inflicting debuffs to enemy targets and healing allies. Few can withstand a lot of damage.

* (**~**) *Summoner* - monsters who takes advantage on creating/sending minions. Minions are usually weak, time limited and deals lesser damage, yet a hassle due to them having debuff inflicting abilities. Monsters who heavily rely on their minions are the opposite.

* (**=**) *Boss* - monsters that are versatile in every situation. Unique and those who opposes extreme danger are considered with this type. They also reside in their lair, concealing them to prevent genocidal annihilation.

Few are hybrids, yet still categorized into a type.

# Structures
These are the locations exclusive to the mod. Currently, there are few that can be seen in-game:

### Secronom Lab
The lab that's been the cause of spreading the newfound mutations throughout the entire lands. It also became the home for the secronom specimens (SS). Lab facilities are small, but there are beneficial items to loot from.

##### Exclusive Monsters:
* _**Failed Mutants**_ - Humanoid test subjects that suffered from intense mutation. Their body alteration serves no purpose, and are considered as trash.
* _**Bio-Organic-Weapons**_ - Test subjects, with successful mutations that are built for combats. These zombies are rare, and few wears power armors as their battle suit.
* _**Enigmas**_ - Extemely rare mutants with disastrous abilities.
* _**Secronom Dragon**_ - A massive reptilian creature made by the SS lab, whose purpose is to perform widespread eradication of undead... and living. It is locked beneath the facility.

##### Loots:
* **Bionics** - Sometimes industrial.
* **Rare Medicines** - Strong medicines such as morphine.
* **Weaponry** - Some milspec guns inside the safe. Beating the secronom dragon might reward you with a weapon.

### Infected Buildings
These are once normal structures, but after a sudden mutation of a dwelling zed, who obtained 'this' newfound mutation, the whole building became infested with flesh. Loots and its layout are the same, but things are harsher than it was before.

##### Exclusive Monsters:
* _**Fleshknot**_ - The main source of noxious gas lingering throughout the structure. Its growth amplifies the gas, as well as its mass.

##### Loots:
* **Common** - Items found inside a house such as clothing, foods and tools.
* **Prepper** - Rarely found under the basement. Contains weaponry and ammunition.

##### Hazards:
* **Noxious Gas** - Without proper protection against the gas, it will slowly poison you. The poison becomes lethal if you inhale too much or the main source has matured.

### Saddler Gathering Nest
A cavern where saddlers tend to gather and populate. These nests are rarely seen around the world, yet its occupants are troublesome parasites - parasites which takes control of the sentient target's consciousness.

##### Exclusive Monsters:
* _**Saddlers**_ - Insect-like parasites who manipulates the sentient creatures. They go with different types such as **brute** and **scout**, with the **broodmother** as their queen. Poses minimal threat, unless they control a creature.

### Flesh Forest
Forests that has been infested by the crimson horrors. Unlike the infected buildings, its entirety of area is manipulated by one, gigantic creature whose purpose is to spread its domain. Odd formation of terrains and uniquely vile dwelling abominations make it a death trap for unprepared wanderers. Bring your trusty flamethrower and set everything on fire!

* Basically, this location (and pretty much everything about it) was adopted from a thread. It was an old thread, and json stuff wasn't good by that time... But now, things are possible to do without fumbling with C++!

##### Exclusive Monsters:
* _**Crimson Horrors**_ - Monsters that resides in, out or nearby the flesh. The surface monsters usually act as guards, having **flesh sacks** giving birth to **parasytes** and **eye sprouts** alerting the flesh of unwanted visitors. **Veinstalks** rarely appears in the area, which has the ability to expand the flesh beyond its boundary. The inner monsters are much more aggressive: **vein beasts** and **rumblers** are made internally to fend off intruders while the **takens** are creatures consumed by the flesh, manipulated into minions. The **flesh** is the hivemind - hidden in its inescapable lair - and a combat with it is a challenge.

##### Loots:
* **Flesh Chunk** - Chunk of vile, edible meat from the melting flesh. This flesh is known to possess regenerative properties that can mend all your injuries, even the broken ones.

###### Hazards:
* **Compact Environment** - Without environmental protection, the underground flesh will devour you little by little, taking constant damage as long as you're inside.

### Flesh City
A city full of zeds, now overrun by the flesh. The flesh is similar to the forest, but in this case, it is an aggressive type to which it took over a whole city and claimed it as its predominant territory. A towering heap of flesh stands tall at the center, with its thick veins penetrating the ground that pulsates in velvety beats.

* Flesh City is a variant of the flesh forest. It has lesser terrestrial hazards but densely crowded by monsters. 

##### Exclusive Monsters:
* _**Crimson Horrors**_ - Monsters that dwells in the city. The **flesh version** of **zombies** cover most of the vicinity, while on the top of the tower lies the **flesh** - it looks like the underground flesh, but much more fragile and having lesser mass. A combat with it is much more challenging.

##### Loots:
* **City Loots** - Structures in the city has the same loots as before.
* **Flesh Chunk**

###### Hazards:
* **Compact Environment** - Lingers inside the flesh tower.

# Mutations
Secronom's mutation branch (the experimental) are based mostly on a secronom creature's unique appearance/abilities. Once you reach the threshold, you'll be able to acquire a _**core mutation**_ that serves as an upgrade to your existing mutation, only if the mutation is available to do so. They might also have an ability available for activation under the **spellcasting** tab.

* _**Turrets**_ - Advanced sci-fi turrets. They are less damaging compared to real ones, but uses electricity as ammo and can be repaired.
