# oa_early_game_mutations_mod

This mod adds the "body modification clinic". A two Z-level building that allows characters to access mutagen in the early game.

This gives an early game character pre-threshold (good or bad) mutations that they may be stuck with for sometime (i.e. until they can manufacture/collect purifier reliably).

The mod also comes with start scenarios:

"Prospective Mutant"
- starts in the Body Mod Clinic
- limited character pool

"Custom Human"
- starts in the Body Mod Clinic
- limited character pool
- mutations available at character creation

and the profession(s): 

"Inpatient"
- no real starting gear except an XL jumpsuit and a pair of leather sandals.


Beware the other post-humans.

Feedback appreciated.
