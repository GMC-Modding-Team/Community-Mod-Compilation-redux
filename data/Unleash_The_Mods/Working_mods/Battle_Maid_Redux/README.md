# Battle Maid Redux Redux

A semi-comprehensive rebuild of the Battle Maid Redux mod, which itself is a retranslation of a machine translation of a Japanese mod.
Obviously, should not be used with any of the three preceding versions.

Most of the original retranslation has been preserved - credit to TheGoatGod for most of the item descriptions and chats.

WHAT THE MOD ADDS:
- 4 professions
- A new martial art (completely changed from previous versions, see below for details)
- Some weapons and armor
- Some new items
- Maid point system used to power up gear from this mod
- Maid pets
- Probably something else that I've forgotten.
I spent over nine hours translating and porting this and didn't take a single break, go easy on me.

CREDITS:

-TheGoatGod for making the retranslated English version. Previous version credits are kept below

-Original Battle Maid mod can be downloaded from https://www.axfc.net/u/3747115. This mod is a translation of this, I take no credit for the original.

-ChestHole, for inspiring me to do this thanks to his... attempt at porting the mod into English. (sorry)

WHAT'S NEW?
- Mod companions ported over to the NPC system(some remain pets where appropriate).
- New player mutation tree: Shoggoth. Plays a lot like Chimera. Not as strong, but also a lot less self-harmful.
- New Maid type: Milk Maid. Convert NPC followers into milk maids and extract delicious and nourishing fluids from them! 
  Warning - maid followers do not take part in faction camp building
- Weapon and armor rebalance: mod weapons buffed to vanilla levels. Mod clothing now actually provides storage as advertised.

How Do I Get Maid Points?

-Find or craft a master's doll. I admit the system is somewhat silly, but I wasn't sure how to change it.

How Do I Get A [REDACTED] Maid?

-Find the 'impossible scribbles'. Rare spawn in labs. No, [REDACTED] maids aren't bugged. They're not supposed to be able to use items - believe me,
 they're strong enough without them.

How Do I Learn the New Style?

-Choose profession Battle Maid or find 'A Maid's Memoirs' in a mansion.

How Does the New Style Work?

-A lot like Aikido, but with weapons. Extremely risk/reward based - you will either style on your opponents and take no damage or get completely wrecked.
 Survives groups very well with plentiful defensive buffs, but you have to shed those buffs to access your offensive techniques. Relies very heavily
 on getting to Melee 3 and 5.
