This mod were made as a bridge for 2 magic-themed mods: vampiric stuff and arcana. Although this might be a small mod, but it is great for people wanting more gathering quests in exchange for simple rewards.

- This mod only works with the latest experimental of CDDA. Update your client before using this.
- This mod only works once you install the following mods: **Vampiric Stuff** and **Arcana**.

# Arcane Seeker
The arcane seeker is a vampire NPC that only shows up in a certain location when you activate the *Vampiric Stuff + Arcana Mod Extension* before world creation. She will trade with you in very different manner.

## Trades
If you are a decendant of either one of the Arcana's profession (sanguinist, etc.), you have the chance to collaborate and alter your trades with the arcane seeker.

Note that you'll no longer be able to change your answer after responding to her will.

##### Collectibles
Arcana has a large library of strange objects, in which the trader exchanges with. Listed are the current items available for trading.

* *Essences*, your primary fuels to activate arcane artifacts. Usually dropped by anomalous creatures.
* *Trophies*, are the items rarely dropped by certain monster.
* *Artifacts*, are the items in which requires you to raid structures and fight its guardian.

*Price differs in difficulty of obtaining the item.*

##### Validation
The arcane seeker will tell you how much token or money will be given to you in exchange of that item. Below are the things you need to know WHEN validating an item.

* If you *Collaborated for item*, you only gain tokens as a form of currency.
* If you *Collaborated for money*, you only gain a large sum of profits.
* If you *Collaborated for nothing*, you still gain bits of money without getting any tokens.
* If you're not collaborated, you will get both lesser money and tokens.

##### Trading
Once an item is validated, you can now exchange that item for the said price.

##### Tokens
Arcane tokens are exchanged with new items, but these items depend on your days you've survived.
As of now, tokens are traded only for *Vampiric Stuff* mod's few selected items.
