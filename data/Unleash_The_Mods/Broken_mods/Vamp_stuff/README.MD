# Vampiric Stuff: A modification file for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Its [mod thread](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/vampiric-stuffs-mod-thread/16001/1) is at the official CDDA forums

This is the mod I've made a long time ago when I was a mobile CDDA player. It provides mild RPG feeling to the players by partaking a bunch of questlines for simple rewards.

- This mod will only work with the latest experimental of CDDA. Update your client before using this.
- This mod is WIP and fatal crashes may occur... In very rare occasions.
- Turning *Static NPC* on before world creation is **required**.
