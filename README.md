# Description
Welcome to TheGoatGod's Mod Compilation. Currently contains just under 400 mods, not including mainline mods, 14 maintained mods, 50 rebalance mods, 22 legacy mods, 2 tile sets(legacy working but lacks a lot of new items etc...), 49 NO Mods, 8 sound packs. It is currently, at 0.1.5, not entirely bug-free, but it is undergoing constant improvements, should soon be bug-free. Many changes are planned for the future, consolidating mods to reduce the amount of excess and cleaning up the code (even more!).

# Road map

- [ ] fix unleash the mods
- [ ] bump build verion up to next release/experimental
- [ ] fix mods again
- [ ] merge content together to make smaller packages/directional mods that make sence

I hope to start the merging process soon with a bunch of prs. the goal is to bring down the number of mods. you will see name changes to include other mods to make it kinda like the bionic package but not one type of item. however, food will be different from other mods. it might get a bit confusing, to begin with. a lot of mods will get striped into other mods entirely or by pieces. all unwanted content will go into a "bin" type mod where you can get the stuff that doesn't fit in or I'm not planning on adding into their big merge into my mega mod for cdda but this will take time and I plan on adding a lot of content all round I need to know what I'm working with to have a direction to start, I have started some additional content mods that will be included I will add more so this will work. I will need testers and will have to make a new git repo for this

## Cataclysm: Goats Dark Horizons

The idea is to make a massive overhaul of cdda and maintain it, this will be Cataclysm: Goats Dark Horizons (this still might change in future), i want to make this sligtly more terrifying in terms of visuals not being able to see as far, same with guns, this will give the game a harder approach right away, add achivements and give the game A LOAD of content and some features alot more will be added but atm it is a content overhaul. this is CDDA extended and will never make change the base game


- [ ] Main Goals
  - [ ] main story
  - [ ] quests
  - [ ] maps ( faction bases and more)
  - [ ] more - compilation
  - [ ] my mods (early survival ect...)
  - [ ] vehicles (shopping trolly varients and more)
  - [ ] supernatural (monsters and scary encounters) maybe feature
  - [ ] Dangerous animals (mutated and sci-fy)
  - [ ] make a ton of little addons (dark days, qol stuff)
  - [ ] overhaul/merge mods before inclusion and finish them (to an extent or fully implement them)
  - [ ] decide if i want to use pk content (parial implementation might include both)
  - [ ] decide if i want to use aftershock content or a base for the dev
  - [ ] rework mods before inclusion to be in a better style in json (less janky ids no {HMS_MOD_CONTENT_EXAMPLE -> MOD_CONTENT} ) and output to the game (names and descriptions are professional
