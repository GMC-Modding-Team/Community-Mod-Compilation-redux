 Psionic Powers for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Welcome to Psioniclysm!

This is a work in progress, so expect it to be a little messy, but it should be functional.

For the time being there is only one profession included, that's the Awakened Psychokinetic - someone who has just unlocked their mental powers. Once I have expanded things a bit more there will be more advanced classes, as well as branching out into Telepathy and other interesting things.

The way this works is, the more you practice your powers (via the spellcasting key, which you must bind), the more XP you will gain, and when those powers level up from practice, most of the time it will unlock new powers, this is especially true of the starting power, PK Enhance I, every level of that you make it to will unlock a new power, and trust me, you want all of them.

Powers will branch out from there, the more you use your powers, the more they will grow.

Also included are several crafting recipes that will handle the 'Psicraft' skill upgrading, for the time being this is the best method I can come up with, as I can't exactly have you powerleveling your psionic powers by reading a book on 'Mentalism' now can I (Watchmen reference!)?

These are time consuming crafting recipes that will not train your skill in and of themseves, but trust me, they're worth it. 
Once you have completed the craft, you can unpack the item and recieve a skill book and an upgrade item or two, examine them and do what they say. Once your skill is up, you will see another crafting recipe for the next level. I had to add a rock in there for some volume/weight, sorry about that. I'm sure you can find a rock.

Oh! And for the time being, unfortunately, you cannot use the Electrokinetic, it's incomplete and not intended for use. 
Also, as it says in the profession: do not put any points into Psicraft. That would screw with the progression.
